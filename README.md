	**GINTAMA**

FOR ME GINTAMA IS THE  ==GOAT== :smirk:.
Gintama is without a doubt a well-written show which brilliantly incorporates humor and serious elements. With references from different Shonen anime from the Big Three to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and astute wordplay, Gintama offers high-quality humor:underage:.
